From In Bibi's Kitchen by Hawa Hassan and Julia Turshen

Fit fit, torn pieces of flatbreads with spiced butter and yogurt, is a typical dish throughout East Africa and is made with either Ethiopian-style injera, or Eritrean kicha. It's a wonderful way to use up leftover flatbread of any kind. You could even use leftover pita bread. The drier the bread, the more it soaks up the spices and butter. Serve with plain yogurt dollooped on top - a wonderful breakfast or snack.
